       "  'content': 'Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. Python’s elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms.\\n\\nThe Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are freely available in source or binary form for all major platforms from the Python website,  and may be freely distributed. The same site also contains distributions of and pointers to many free third party Python modules, programs and tools, and additional documentation. [...] The Python interpreter is easily extended with new functions and data types implemented in C or C++ (or other languages callable from C). Python is also suitable as an extension language for customizable applications.\\n\\nThis tutorial introduces the reader informally to the basic concepts and features of the Python language and system. Be aware that it expects you to have a basic understanding of programming in general. It helps to have a Python interpreter handy for hands-on experience, but all examples are self-contained, so the tutorial can be read off-line as well. [...] For a description of standard objects and modules, see The Python Standard Library. The Python Language Reference gives a more formal definition of the language. To write extensions in C or C++, read Extending and Embedding the Python Interpreter and Python/C API Reference Manual. There are also several books covering Python in depth.\\n\\nThis tutorial does not attempt to be comprehensive and cover every single feature, or even every commonly used feature. Instead, it introduces many of Python’s most noteworthy features, and will give you a good idea of the language’s flavor and style. After reading it, you will be able to read and write Python modules and programs, and you will be ready to learn more about the various Python library modules described in The Python Standard Library.'},\n",

[...] ## Why Python?\\n\\n Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).\\n Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.\\n Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.\\n Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.\\n Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.\\n\\n### Good to know [...] ### Python Syntax compared to other programming languages\\n\\n Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics.\\n Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses.\\n Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.\\n\\n### Example\\n\\nprint(\"Hello, World!\")\\n\\nTry it Yourself »\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Video: Python Introduction\\n\\n❮ Previous Next ❯\\n\\n★ +1\\n\\nSign in to track progress\\n\\n#### COLOR PICKER\\n\\nREMOVE ADS\\n\\nGET CERTIFIED\\n\\nFOR TEACHERS\\n\\nCONTACT US; \"Contact us about sales or errors\")\\n\\n×\\n\\n## Contact Sales'},\n",

This commitment, coupled with its robust order book, strong financial health, and strategic initiatives, positions Suzlon to capitalize on India's ambitious energy transition goals. The industry is projected to surpass 10 GW in installations over the next two years, with India aiming for 100 GW of wind capacity by 2030, creating a significant tailwind for Suzlon. [...] Suzlon Energy Limited, a key player in India's renewable energy sector, has reported a stellar performance for the third quarter of fiscal year 2026 (Q3 FY26), underscoring its robust operational momentum and strategic foresight. The company achieved its highest-ever quarterly deliveries, reaching an impressive 617 megawatts (MW), which propelled its consolidated revenue to INR 4,228 crore. This represents a significant 42% year-on-year (YoY) growth, reflecting strong demand and efficient execution. For the first nine months of FY26, Suzlon's deliveries surged by 66% to 1,625 MW, surpassing the entire FY25 volume of 1,550 MW. This accelerated performance translated into a consolidated EBITDA of INR 2,058 crore, marking a 77% YoY increase, and a Profit Before Tax (PBT) of INR 1,589 crore, [...] A significant strategic move is the launch of DevCo, a stand-alone FDRE (Firm and Dispatchable Renewable Energy) project development vertical. This initiative aims to identify potential sites over a five-year horizon, acquire land, secure grid connectivity, and obtain necessary local approvals. By preparing projects in advance, Suzlon expects to accelerate execution, increase its EPC share, and facilitate strategic sales with large customers, with results anticipated from the second half of next year through FY28.\"},\n",
